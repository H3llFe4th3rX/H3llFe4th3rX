I'm gonna write this here so anybody who knows its for u then please read. I am NOT excusing my actions BUT i do have really bad memory issues. I have literally 0 idea what it it, what it could be, but i have terrible memory. Espically when it comes down to things that have stressed me out so i push them away until i forget. And i also say random shit in the heat of the moment. I push people away by saying shit that isn't true because of personal issues i have. I'm still working on myself but i guess that for some reason i decided to be an asshole for literally 0 reason at all?? I'm not saying that like i'm blaming it on these things, because yeah i did say those things, i typed them out, was infact me. But sometimes i take it too far, say the wrong shit and say things i do not mean at all. And when i 'lie' like that, i stick with those lies for some odd reason, i feel wrong if i don't, but wrong if i do. yk? it's just an odd situations. I hope this like slightly clears things up... atleast alittle bit... I suck at communicating when it involves things about me since i don't enjoy everything being about me. Just makes me icky. 

I will be unactive from MAY 23RD to somewhere in AUGUST. I am losing my computer and will NOT be able to play PT. If you want to contact me, my discord is H3llFe3th3rX. I will have my computer back in august! Basically.... My school is giving us new ones over the summer so....... Hehe..... But i will be back! Trust... OR IF!!! My plans work, i will be getting a desktop sometime soon!!!!!! So i will be able to play then! :3

I'm NOT making ts fancy so if you are here to learn abt me, then here's the holy YAP! I'm Touya, or literally whatever you know me by, or whatever skin I'm sitting as. Typically, I AFK as Sam from SDV or a random character. I am 14, I turn 15 in 10 days (when I'm making this,,,,)!! I go by he/him pronouns, and I'm gay MLM! I typically sit by the ghost BC area, docks, or somewhere near spawn! Or I tend to wander with friends. I am a very nice person, I promise! Feel free to interact! I'm only rude if that's the way I'm being treated OR you are weird asf.... I'm VERY extroverted and I love talking to people! But I do tend to sit alone.... But that does NOT mean I'm okay with c+h. Please ask before c+h ing, it makes me a bit uncomfortable! Unless you are a friend, then feel free, idm. If you are trying to interact with me and I'm not replying or am in menu, I'm probably offtab! Send me a whisper and I'll probably reply! For people who are in VC with me, maybe for regi work or smth, I am LOUD. I am a generally loud person, and I cannot help that. If you don't like it, then leave or mute me. There's a mute button for a REASON, so don't make everyone feel bad just bc everything's loud, you can turn ur volume down or mute me. I also vocal stim! I don't mean to, just something I do! Just because I get into drama does NOT make me a bad person! I tend to fight with people because I am big on getting my point across. I also get fired up easily! I am a VERY bold and blunt person. Basically saying, if I don't like you, you are going to know that I don't like you. I will not tolerate being around or talking to you if i don't like you. I have stong opinions on things and perspectives! If you don't like them, hide me or block me. It's as simple as that. If you physically are incapable of doing so, then maybe you shouldn't be on the game. I block and hide FREELY. I do have a dni and it's on my strawpage! Please read that before interacting so that you are aware! ADDING MORE LMAO FINALLY. If i say i have a favorite character that has done bad things (example, Endeavor from MHA, or Merle and Shane from TWD, or Henry Bowers from IT) i do NOT support their actions. I just like the character. 0 need to point out how the character is a bad character bc that is NOT gonna stop me from liking them, and same from shipping them with other characters (NOTHING WEIRD I PROMISE). I DO ship character but i don't bring them up because no matter what it is, it's gonna get shit on by somebody. If you wanna know, don't be a judger and be accepting then MAYBE i'll tell you. Otherwise, ships and shippers DNI. Espically Dabihawks and Bakudeku. I hate both of those with a fat burning passion. If my skin says AGEREG or anything like it, please do NOT interact with anything negative or sexual. I am age regressed and hearing shit like that while i'm in that state fucks with my head even more. So refrain from doing anything. I have a few skins i sit as when i'm like that. For example : Vincent SDV, Helly Kitty, Touya (KID VERSION) MHA, Mackenzie from Bluey, or any of my plushie dreadful cosplays. Thas it for now :3
